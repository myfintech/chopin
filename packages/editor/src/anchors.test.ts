/**
 * Resolving where a decision lives against this editor's tree.
 *
 * A Lexical key is per-editor, so the server can only say which blocks it means
 * as Yjs relative positions and every client works out its own keys. That is
 * the whole of what `relate` does, and it had no test — which is how a two-part
 * relationship nobody could tell apart survived as long as it did.
 *
 * Real Lexical and real Yjs, because the question is whether positions resolve.
 * What the resolved keys are then used for needs a browser and is not here.
