/**
 * Sending frames.
 *
 * Three shapes, because the distinction matters at every call site: a reply
 * goes to the one socket that asked and carries its `rid`; a relay goes to
 * everyone except the member who caused it, because they already know; a
 * broadcast goes to the whole room because the server decided something.
 *
 * Room membership is Bun's own pub/sub topic, so a relay is one call rather
 * than a loop over a set we would otherwise have to keep correct.
