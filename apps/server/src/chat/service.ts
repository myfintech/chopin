/**
 * Chat.
 *
 * One transcript per room, shared by everyone in it, and one turn at a time.
 * Messages that address the agent are queued rather than refused while it is
 * working: the plan belongs to the agent for the length of a turn, but the
 * Chat does not, and silencing somebody because a colleague prompted
 * first is a poor way to run a room with two people in it.
 *
 * Messages that do not address it are ordinary conversation. They are carried
 * into the next turn as context rather than starting one, so people can decide
 * something between themselves and the agent turns up already knowing.
 *
 * Every message reaching the model is prefixed with its author's handle. The
 * agent is planning with a group, and "Alice prefers X, but Bob raised Y" is
 * the kind of thing it has to be able to say back.
