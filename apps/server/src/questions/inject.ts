/**
 * Asking a question without an agent.
 *
 * The questionnaire flow is the most collaborative thing here and the least
 * reachable: normally only a planning turn produces one. Waiting for the agent
 * to exist before any of it could be exercised would mean building the shared
 * draft, the two-phase resolution and the sidecar blind.
 *
 * Enabled only when `DEV_QUESTIONS` is set. It mints ids and asks, which is
 * exactly what the agent's tool will do — so the path this exercises is the
 * real one, not a rehearsal of it.
