/**
 * How long the reader has left to notice each thing the agent changed.
 *
 * A mark waits until it has been looked at. The agent can write below the fold
 * while somebody is reading the top of the plan, and a mark that spent its few
 * seconds off screen would have told nobody anything — so nothing starts
 * counting down until it has been in the viewport, and until then it is an
 * unread marker rather than a flash. Unread markers do not expire on a clock;
 * that is the whole point of deferring them.
 *
 * Once seen the clock runs whether or not the mark is still in view. Two
 * states and one timer: a mark can never go dark and light up again on a later
 * scroll, which would read as a second edit that never happened. Only more
 * work from the agent restarts a clock that is running, so the marks from one
 * turn fade together rather than section by section.
 *
 * Nothing here knows what a mark looks like, where it is, or that there is a
 * document. It is the part worth testing and the part that does not need a
 * browser — the test runtime has neither a DOM nor a controllable clock, which
 * is also why the duration is an argument rather than a constant.
