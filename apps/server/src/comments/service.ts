/**
 * Comments, as a room offers them.
 *
 * A thread marks a phrase and collects what people said about it. Accepting one
 * is the room deciding: the thread freezes, a `<Decision>` goes into the plan,
 * and the agent is asked to revise the prose. Dismissing closes it without the
 * agent.
 *
 * Accepting is two-phase for the same reason answering a questionnaire is — the
 * record and the document both have to change, and nobody may be told it is
 * final until both have. If the document write fails the claim is rolled back
 * and the thread is still open, which every client already knows how to render.
 *
 * Where a thread points is not in these frames. A passage moves whenever the
 * plan does, and `plan:anchors` already carries every such relationship as one
 * authoritative snapshot, so putting it here too would be a second source of
 * truth updated on a different schedule.
