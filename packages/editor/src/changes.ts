 * reached it. Everything is drawn by attribute on a block that already exists,
 * so the marks add no element and take no space — an agent editing below the
 * fold must not shift the sentence somebody is in the middle of typing, and a
 * mark that expires a few seconds later must not shift it back.
 *
 * A block that has gone cannot carry a mark, so a hole is drawn on the edge of
 * the block still beside it and the side is part of the address. That is also
 * why a hole can only ever say that something was here: what it was lives in
 * the list behind the chips, which is the one place a removal can be read
 * after the fact.
 *
 * Nothing is written into the document. These are one reader's marks, arriving
 * at a different moment for everybody in the room, and putting them in the
 * document would send them to everyone else and make them undoable.
