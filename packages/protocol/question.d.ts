/**
 * Collaborative questions.
 *
 * A questionnaire's definition is frozen once asked, with one exception: any
 * member with write access may append an option while it is open (`AddOption`).
 * Its answer is not frozen either: it lives in a
 * shared CRDT owned by the server, so everyone present converges on one draft
 * before somebody submits it back to the agent that is waiting on it.
 *
 * There is one answer, not one per person, because there is one decision. Any
 * member may submit it, and who did is recorded — a plan should be able to say
 * who decided a thing, not merely what was decided.
