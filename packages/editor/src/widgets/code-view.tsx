/**
 * Rendering a fence as coloured code, and a patch as a diff.
 *
 * `@pierre/diffs` does both, over Shiki, and is used only to draw: the source
 * of every block on this page stays where it was, as Lexical text children
 * under Yjs, and what is drawn here is a second, read-only view of it. The
 * library has an edit mode and it must not be turned on — it would put a
 * character model of its own beside the one the room is collaborating in, and
 * the two would disagree the moment two people typed.
 *
 * It arrives on demand. Shiki's grammars and this library together are larger
 * than everything else the editor loads, and a plan with no code in it should
 * pay none of it.
 *
 * A diff fence is a unified patch or it is not a diff. The parser is asked to
 * throw rather than to salvage, because half a patch rendered as a diff is a
 * change nobody made: the hunk headers are what carry the filename and the
 * line numbers, and inventing them from a loose run of `+` and `-` lines would
 * put both in the reader's head with nothing behind them. What it refuses is
 * shown as coloured diff text instead, which is what it is.
