/**
 * The rails a table is reshaped from.
 *
 * A grip per column above the table and per row beside it: the handle a drag
 * starts from, the button a row or column is removed by, and — between two of
 * them — where a new one is inserted.
 *
 * They are drawn as a fixed overlay measured from cell rectangles rather than
 * as chrome inside the node, because a `<table>` cannot contain a `<div>`. The
 * `data-plan-chrome` slot that callouts and tabs portal into is not available
 * at any price here: the browser hoists a stray div straight back out of a
 * table, so the choice is between measuring and subclassing `TableNode`. This
 * is the technique the selection bubble already uses.
 *
 * Only one table has rails at a time — whichever the pointer is over, or the
 * caret is in. Rails on every table at once would be a page of grey furniture
 * around prose that is mostly not tables. Within that table only the row and
 * column being pointed at, or holding the caret, draw a grip; an insert button
 * shows only while its seam is aimed at.
 *
 * There is no test for this file, on purpose: it is rectangles and pointers all
 * the way down and the test runtime has no DOM. What can be decided without one
 * — which seam a drop means, what a rail's boxes are, what the table permits —
 * lives in `geometry.ts` and `shape.ts`, which are tested.
